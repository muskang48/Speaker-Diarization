# Speaker-Diarization
Speaker Diarization is the procees which aims to find who spoke when in an audio and the total number of speakers in an audio recording.
This project contains:
- Voice Activity Detection (using webrtcvad)
- Speaker Segmentation based on Bi-LSTM RNN
- Embedding Extraction (d-vector extraction)
- Clustering (k-MEANS and Mean Shift)
## Voice Activity Detection
Voice activity detection (VAD) is a technique in which the presence or absence of human speech is detected. This part has been completed using a module devloped by google called as WebRTC. It's an open framework for the web that enables Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities in the browser. The voice activity dector is one of the specific module present in WebRTC. This basic working of WebRTC based VAD is as follows:
- WebRTC VAD is a Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) based voice activity detector 
- GMM model using PLP features
- Two full covariance Gaussians: One for speech, and one for Non-Speech is used.
To learn about PLP we followed [this paper](http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Publikationen/2005/Hoenig05-RPL.pdf).

Following is brief analysis of PLP. PLP consists of the following steps: 

(i) The power spectrum is computed from the windowed speech signal. \
(ii) A frequency warping into the Bark scale is applied. \
(iii) The auditorily warped spectrum is convoluted with the power spectrum of the simulated critical-band masking curve to simulate the critical-band integration of human hearing. \
(iv) The smoothed spectrum is down-sampled at intervals of ≈ 1 Bark. The three steps frequency warping, smoothing and sampling (ii-iv) are integrated into a single filter-bank called Bark filter-bank.\
(v) An equal-loudness pre-emphasis weights the filter-bank outputs to simulate the sensitivity of hearing.\
(vi) The equalized values are transformed according to the power law of Stevens by raising each to the power of 0.33. The resulting auditorily warped line spectrum is further processed by (vii) linear prediction (LP). Precisely speaking, applying LP to the auditorily warped line spectrum means that we compute the predictor coefficients of a (hypothetical) signal that has this warped spectrum as a power spectrum. \
(viii) Finally, cepstral coefficients are obtained from the predictor coefficients by a recursion that is equivalent to the logarithm of the model spectrum followed by an inverse Fourier transform. Following figure shows a comparative scheme of PLP computation. \

So in WebRTC these PLP features are computed for 10 ms frame and then two Variance models are compared to find whether this frame has audio or not.
## Speaker Segementation
Speaker segmentation constitues the heart of speaker diarization. The idea to exactly identify the location of speaker change point in the order to miliseconds is still an open challenge. For this part we have tried to develop a state of art system which is a BiLSTM network that is trained using a special SMORMS3 optimizer. SMORMS3 optimizer is a hybrid optimizer developed using RMSprop and Adam optimizers. SMORMS3 stands for "squared mean over root mean squared cubed". This [link](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20150420.html) provides a detailied analysis of SMORMS3. \
Now, coming to our speaker segmentation part, the architecture which ultilizes this SMORMS3 optimizer works on the principle that addresses speaker change detection as a binary sequence labelling task using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks (Bi-LSTM). Given an audio recording, speaker change detection aims at finding the boundaries between speech turns of different speakers. In Figure below, the expected output of such a system would be the list of timestamps between spk1 & spk2, spk2 & spk1, and spk1 & spk4.
- First we extract the features, let x be a sequence of MFCC features extracted for a short (a few milliseconds) overlapping sliding window. The speaker change detection task is then turned into a binary sequence labeling task by defining y = (y1, y2...yT ) ∈ {0, 1}^T
such that y_{i} = 1 if there is a speaker change during the ith frame, and y_{i} = 0 otherwise. The objective is then to find a function f : X → Y that matches a feature sequence to a label sequence. We propose to model this function f as a recurrent neural network trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function.

- The actual architecture of the network f is depicted in Figure below. It is composed of two Bi-LSTM (Bi-LSTM 1 and 2) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) whose weights are shared across the sequence. Bi-LSTMs allow to process sequences in forward and backward directions, making use of both past and future contexts. The output of both, the forward and backward LSTMs are concatenated and fed forward to the next layer. The shared MLP is made of three fully connected feedforward layers, using tanh activation function for the first two layers, and a sigmoid activation function for the last layer, in order to output a score between 0 and 1. \

## Combining VAD and Speaker Segmentation
In our code once the results from above modules were obtained, we combined the results in logical way such that we obtain frames of arbitrary seconds depending on the voiced part and the speaker change part. This can be explained with an example; let us suppose we have first performed VAD and found that from 2 to 3 seconds there is some voice. In next part of speaker segmentation, we found that at 2.5 seconds there is a speaker change point. So, what we did was we split this audio frame of 1 seconds into two parts: frame 1 starts at 2 seconds and ends at 2.5 seconds and frame 2 from 2.5 seconds to 3seconds. Similarly, let us suppose that we find that from 3 to 3.5 seconds there is some voice and then there is a silence of 1 second i.e. exactly at 4 sec some voice is coming into play. Now using speaker change part we found out that at 4 seconds there is speaker change point again. We combined it in such way which defined that there is new speaker at 4 seconds. All such logical results were combined to give per frame output.

def group_intervals(a):
    a = a.tolist()
    ans = []

    curr = None
    for x in a:
        # no previous interval under consideration
        if curr == None:
          curr = x
        else:
            # check if we can merge the intervals
            if x[0]-curr[1] < 1:
                curr[1] = x[1]
            else:
            # if we cannot merge, push the current element to ans
                ans.append(curr)
                curr = x

        if curr is not None:
            ans.append(curr)

    d1 = np.asarray(ans)
    d2 = np.unique(d1)
    d3 = d2.reshape(int(len(d2)/2),2)
    return d3

          temp1 = [i[j],i[j+1]]
          z.append(temp1)
  
  return np.asarray(z)
```
## Embedding Extraction
This part now has to handle the idea to differentiate speakers. As mentioned in previous parts the frames extracted will go through the process of feature extraction. Let’s suppose we have a frame of 3 seconds starting from 4.5 to 7.5 sec, we extract the d-vectors for first 1.5 or 2 seconds of a single frame. To extract d-vectors we use the pyannote libraries pretrained models. The detailed analysis of pyannote can found uisng their [github repo](https://pyannote.github.io/) and also from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01255.pdf).
## Clustering (k-MEANS and Mean Shift)
Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis technique used to get an intuition about the structure of the data. It can be defined as the task of identifying subgroups in the data such that data points in the same subgroup (cluster) are very similar while data points in different clusters are very different. In other words, we try to find homogeneous subgroups within the data such that data points in each cluster are as similar as possible according to a similarity measure such as euclidean-based distance or correlation-based distance. The decision of which similarity measure to use is application-specific. 
### Kmeans Algorithm
Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the cluster’s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points are within the same cluster.
The way k-means algorithm works is as follows:
- Specify number of clusters K.
- Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
- Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isn’t changing.
- Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
- Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
- Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster. \
The approach kmeans follows to solve the problem is called Expectation-Maximization. Following [Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a) gives more idea.
### Mean Shift Algorithm
Mean Shift is very similar to the K-Means algorithm, except for one very important factor, you do not need to specify the number of groups prior to training. The Mean Shift algorithm finds clusters on its own. For this reason, it is even more of an "unsupervised" machine learning algorithm than K-Means. Mean shift builds upon the concept of kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE is a method to estimate the underlying distribution for a set of data. It works by placing a kernel on each point in the data set. A kernel is a fancy mathematical word for a weighting function. There are many different types of kernels, but the most popular one is the Gaussian kernel. Adding all of the individual kernels up generates a probability surface (e.g., density function). Depending on the kernel bandwidth parameter used, the resultant density function will vary. \
Mean shift exploits KDE idea by imagining what the points would do if they all climbed up hill to the nearest peak on the KDE surface. It does so by iteratively shifting each point uphill until it reaches a peak. Depending on the kernel bandwidth used, the KDE surface (and end clustering) will be different. As an extreme case, imagine that we use extremely tall skinny kernels (e.g., a small kernel bandwidth). The resultant KDE surface will have a peak for each point. This will result in each point being placed into its own cluster. On the other hand, imagine that we use an extremely short fat kernels (e.g., a large kernel bandwidth). This will result in a wide smooth KDE surface with one peak that all of the points will climb up to, resulting in one cluster. Kernels in between these two extremes will result in nicer clusterings.  \
 Following [Link](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/05/26/mean-shift-clustering/) gives more idea.
# Dataset
1. AMI Corpus Data
The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. For our project we have recordings of 2003 metting. There are four files with total length of more than 2 hours. Annotations have been already provided with this standard dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from the following [link](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/download/). There are a total of four files namely ('ES2003a', 'ES2003b', 'ES2003c', 'ES2003d') which we have used.
2. Hindi A Data <br />
Hindi A data is taken from a [Hindi News Channel Debate on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yj8K2ZHttA&t=424s). The duration of dataset is approx 2 Hours. This data set is split into 3 files Hindi_01, Hindi_02 and Hindi_03 having approximately equal duration. The complete dataset is manually annotated. [Link to Hindi A dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16XCqfCaNo9djdx_TVK3hHxP6by3RaKU5). This link consists of 3 audio files Hindi_01.wav, Hindi_02.wav and Hindi_03.wav and also the manually annotated csv file. The annotations are in the format (filename/duration/offset/speaker_id).
3. Hindi B Data  
Hindi B data is also taken from Hindi News channel Debate but it is more noise free and overlapping is less. Its duration is around 1 hour It is taken from this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGEWWAly_-0). This dataset is also split into 3 files Hindi1_01,Hindi1_02, Hindi1_03. The complete dataset is manually annotated.
[Link to Hindi B Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jvSxEaMNx7IjzQIlrT4Vnl4x8TZTtZaB). This link consists of 3 audio files Hindi1_01.wav,Hindi1_02.wav,Hindi1_03.wav along with manually annotated .csv file.
4. Other testing Datasets
desh.wav audio file was extracted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqA9ISVcPD0&t=24s). This is a YouTube video recorded on April 15, 2020.
modi_2.wav audio file was extracted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS1eOqGs3H0&t=725s). This is a YouTube video recorded on
May 30, 2020.
[Link to these testing Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M6OVvNJeroElBYksoQy6Y4L9RgC1Z5JC). 
We have not manually annotated these files. For these file the the Hypothesis were generated using the code and Visualized manually by listening to the audio.
### NOTE
1. All the hindi datasets were taken from YouTube Video recordings. The audio files (.wav) from Youtube Video were extracted using the MiniTool uTube Downloader and then these files were converted from stereo type to mono type using Audacity software. The spliiting of the files was also done using Audacity. These splitted files were then exported as .wav files having sampling rate 48000Hz and were 16 bit PCM encoded.
2. Hindi A and Hindi B datasets do not have the same speakers. In both the datasets, speakers are different and none of the speakers is common.
# How to Run the code
This project contains 4 .ipynb files. One can open the files directly in google Colab.\
Change_detection.ipynb file creates and trains the model for Segmentation. sp_diarization.ipynb is the major file for Complete diarization and uses the saved pre-trained model.\
Segmentation.ipynb and VAD.ipynb are colab files to get seperate results for Segmentation and Voice Activity Detection.\
The complete dizrization system was evaluated for two clustering approaches: K-means and MeanShift. kmeans.py and meanshift.py (python files of both the clustering methods) are uploaded.
- For running the code in google colab you need to upload the required audio test file and wieghts of pre-trained model to your google drive account.
1. Mount the Google Drive.
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
2. Define the path to pre-trained model file and testing audio file. You can add the files to your drive and redefine the path.
```
h5_model_file = '/content/drive/My Drive/SRU/model_hindi_2.h5'
segmented, n_clusters, hyp_df, result_hypo = diarization('/content/drive/My Drive/SRU/Hindi_01.wav')
reference, ref_df = reference_gen('/content/drive/My Drive/SRU/hindi_annotations1.csv')
```
# Analysis
In this part we will discuss about the major analysis of the code and the intepretations of the results.
1. Voice activity Detector <br />
Following is the code to find the voice and non voice parts:

```
import contextlib
import numpy as np
import wave
import librosa
import webrtcvad


def read_wave(path):
    with contextlib.closing(wave.open(path, 'rb')) as wf:
        num_channels = wf.getnchannels()
        assert num_channels == 1
        sample_width = wf.getsampwidth()
        assert sample_width == 2
        sample_rate = wf.getframerate()
        assert sample_rate in (8000, 16000, 32000, 48000)
        pcm_data = wf.readframes(wf.getnframes())
        return pcm_data, sample_rate


class Frame(object):
  def __init__(self, bytes, timestamp, duration):
        self.bytes = bytes
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.duration = duration


def frame_generator(frame_duration_ms, audio, sample_rate):
    n = int(sample_rate * (frame_duration_ms / 1000.0) * 2)
    offset = 0
    timestamp = 0.0
    duration = (float(n) / sample_rate) / 2.0
    while offset + n < len(audio):
        yield Frame(audio[offset:offset + n], timestamp, duration)
        timestamp += duration
        offset += n


def vad_collector(vad, frames, sample_rate):
    is_speech = []
    for frame in frames:
        is_speech.append(vad.is_speech(frame.bytes, sample_rate))
    return is_speech


def vad(file):
    audio, sample_rate = read_wave(file)
    vad = webrtcvad.Vad(3)
    frames = frame_generator(10, audio, sample_rate)
    frames = list(frames)
    segments = vad_collector(vad, frames, sample_rate)
    return segments

def speech(file):
  dummy = 0
  data = []
  segments = vad(file)
  audio, sr = librosa.load(file, sr=16000)
  for i in segments:
    if i == True:
      data.append(audio[dummy:dummy + 480])
      dummy = dummy + 480
    else:
      dummy = dummy + 480
  data = np.ravel(np.asarray(data))

  return data

def fxn(file):
  segments = vad(file)
  segments = np.asarray(segments)
  dummy = 0.01*np.where(segments[:-1] != segments[1:])[0] +.01
  # dummy = np.delete(dummy, len(dummy)-1)
  voice = dummy.reshape(int(len(dummy)/2),2)
  
  return voice
```
The function at the end of above code "fxn" gives the output of which frame is voiced. The basic working has been already explained in above section. Output is a numpy array contain the pairs which define the start and end of a frame. The following results have been generated from AMI corpus data file 'ES2003a'. \
![04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57112474/83508965-4e39cc00-a4e8-11ea-89f4-3cd765d89e69.JPG) <br />

As we can see, segment from 2.19 to 3.19 seconds conatins a single frame similarly the last frame is from 1139.58 to 1139.72 sec. <br />
2. Segmentation Model <br />
Now comes the core part of detecting changes, the basic architecture and working has been explained before. What we see here is for AMI corpus data set we have trained this model for all four files. We provide the model with both the MFCC features along with the annotation. Similarly, for other dataset i.e. Hindi A and Hindi B we have given the model all audio files along with annotation to learn the speaker change point. Following is the model that we have used:
```
TensorFlow 1.x selected.
Using TensorFlow backend.
Model: "sequential_1"

Non-trainable params: 0
_________________________________________________________________
``` 
Having total 571,489 trainable parameters it takes around 2 and half hours on AMI corpus dataset to be trained. After training the model we determine the change points, Following visual representation shows the change point on ES2003a file of AMI corpus: <br />
![Segmentation Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61666843/80796726-94d09980-8bbd-11ea-94f9-a952e55d9991.png)

3. Combining VAD and Speaker Segmentation <br />
Next in this part we have combined the two outputs in a logical manner as explained earlier, sample output is as, \
![06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57112474/83509868-b89f3c00-a4e9-11ea-8666-d0a0fb3249ed.JPG) <br />
As seen each frame corresponds to a single speaker. All that remains is to find which speakers are same and which are different. The above results are for ES2003a file of AMI corpus.

4. Clustering and Embedding Extraction <br />
The second most core aspect of this project is to correctly determine who is speaking. We have used pyannote, which extracts the d-vectors of frames generated in last section.
 ```
 import torch
from pyannote.core import Segment

def embeddings_(audio_path,resegmented,range):
  model_emb = torch.hub.load('pyannote/pyannote-audio', 'emb')
  # print(f'Embedding has dimension {model.dimension:d}.')
  
  embedding = model_emb({'audio': audio_path})
  for window, emb in embedding:
    assert isinstance(window, Segment)
    assert isinstance(emb, np.ndarray)

  y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=16000)
  myDict={}
  myDict['audio'] = audio_path
  myDict['duration'] = len(y)/sr

  data=[]
  for i in resegmented:
    excerpt = Segment(start=i[0], end=i[0]+range)
    emb = model_emb.crop(myDict,excerpt)
    data.append(emb.T)
  data= np.asarray(data)
  
  return data.reshape(len(data),512)
 ```
The function "resegmented" asks for the resegmented numpy array along with the factor that governs the length of audio frame to be considered to find d-vectors per frame.
   - Number of Speakers in an audio is equal to the number of clusters formed. \
![07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57112474/83510609-e933a580-a4ea-11ea-9d22-f2026bce7d9f.png) \
This clustering result is from the KMeans Algo which take input of how many speakers are there.


5. Diarization Output Visulaiztion <br />
The final part is to now evaluate how true we are. For this again we have used PyAnnote libraries metric module which contains DER (Diarization Error rate) function that helps us to say how wrong we are in determining who spoke when. Following is just the visualition part of our hypothesis and groud truth. The duration is in seconds. (A,B,C.. shows the speaker). Apart from the issue of oversegmentation and overlapping in the hypothesis generated the hypothesis almost matches the Groundtruth. The colour in both hypothesis and groundtruth might not be the same, we have to map it.
    - Hypothesis\
    It shows who spoke when in an audio. 
    ![Hypothesis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61666843/80796883-ff81d500-8bbd-11ea-8f16-313c674d9137.png)
    - Groundtrurh\
    It is the visulaization of manually annotated audio file.
    ![GroundTruth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61666843/80796988-3f48bc80-8bbe-11ea-9b22-bce43b76b3ae.png)
 
 6. Diarization Error Rate <br />
 Diarization error rate (DER) is the de facto standard metric used for evaluating and comparing speaker diarization systems. It is defined as follows \
 ![08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57112474/83510965-8262bc00-a4eb-11ea-9c1d-befe80d65fdd.png) \
where false alarm is the duration of non-speech incorrectly classified as speech, missed detection is the duration of speech incorrectly classified as non-speech, confusion is the duration of speaker confusion, and total is the total duration of speech in the reference.


# Results

1. AMI Corpus - As part of initial experimentation we produced results which were evaluated on DER mainly. <br />
    - DER - 36.7% (Using Mean-Shift Clustering) <br />
 
![Capture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44304305/83499265-b681b100-a4da-11ea-9c7d-f5d59c8f5022.JPG)

2. Hindi A - To experiment with Hindi language we made this data set from a group discussion on youutube. This was mostly noisy and overalap was also more. Because of the noise and the overlap we got DER as 60% (Kmeans Clustering).
![Capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44304305/83498771-f5fbcd80-a4d9-11ea-86eb-99ffa77a41b3.JPG)

3. Hindi B - The results from Hindi A were not convincing so we made another dataset we called Hindi B which had lesser overlaps and minimum noise. The DER we got was 
    - DER - 12.1% (Using Mean-Shift Clustering)
    - DER - 20.8% (Using Kmeans Clustering) \
    The below results are for Hindi1_01.wav file which was part of Hindi B dataset.

4. Testing\
To test the model that we trained using Hindi B data  we used part of Hindi A dataset as testing file.The speakers of both the dataset are different. We got 27% DER. <br /> The below results are for Hindi_01.wav file of Hindi A dataset.\

We also tested our model for other audios. We didn't annotated those files so grountruth and der are not possible to find out. We generated the hypothesis which was showing almost similar results if we listen to the meeting data. <br />
